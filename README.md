## Married Women's Economic Rights Reform, 1835-1920

* debtfree – Year of passage of state law protecting married women’s separate property from her husband’s debts
* effectivemwpa – Year of passage of state law granting married women control and management rights over their separate property
* earnings – Year of passage of state law granting married women ownership of their wages or earnings on par with other separate property
* wills – Year of passage of state law granting married women the ability to write wills without their husband's consent or other restrictions
* soletrader – Year of passage of state law granting married women as a class the right to sign contracts and engage in business without consent of husband

Note: This study examines the passage of married women’s economic rights reforms prior to the
Nineteenth Amendment (1920, granting women the right to vote at the national level), so states
that passed laws later (i.e. Florida passed a control-and-management law in 1943) should be
treated as missing data for the purposes of data visualization.
